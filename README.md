# Scratch
###Chatrooms

This is currently the placeholder for a chatroom app. The purpose of the app will be to explore web sockets through a chatroom app.

There will be no accounts. In order to chat with someone, a user will click "Create chat", and a new chatroom will be generated. In order to invite other users to their chatroom, they will have to send the link. New users will show up and have to enter a name.

Chatlogs will exist only in the browser and will no longer exist for the user once they've closed the tab. The room will still exist, but with no saved logs.

In addition, messages will show up live as they're typed. They will be committed to the chat log as soon as the enter key is pressed.
